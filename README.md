# Pico-8_Games
Some of my Pico-8 projects. For those that do not know: Pico-8 is a virtual console. All code written for it is written in Lua with some custom functions for the pico-8 added.

None of the scripts here include the image or sound components. I'll try to add the full cartridges (saved as PNG files they include scripting, sound, and iamgery) later.
