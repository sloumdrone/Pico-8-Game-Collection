# Pico-8 Game Library
This repo exists to hold a number of different coding projects for the [Pico-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pico-8) virtual console.

The games are coded in Pico-8 Lua and only the scripts are included here at this point. I plan to add the cartridge files (distributed as PNGs) and possibly binaries in the not distant future.

## Dependencies
 - For \*.p8 files: Pico-8
 - Binaries will run on their intended platform
 - JS exports will run in browser
